# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## You can create your own json file to save data as well as perform operations in it using json-server.

Step 1- We first need create a database for json file i.e. db.json.

## To create a json-server we first need to install it using npm (npm install json-server).

Step 2- Now to run our json server , we first need to include it in our scripts tag in package.json. Now the default port for json server
        is port 3000 in which our app is already running. So to change the port, we need give command --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3003 or whichever port you want your json server to run.

## Now both the server i.e our app as well as our json server are running on different ports. So basically we need them to run concurrently . 

Step 3- Now to run them concurrently , we need to include a command to run both of them together with a single command in scripts. So we need 
to  install concurrently using npm which can run multiple commands concurrently.
